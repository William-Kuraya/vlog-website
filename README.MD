###Let us make a simple chocolate cake
##Ingredients:
* 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
* 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs   
* 1 cup milk
* ½ cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup boiling water   
* 1 cup white sugar
##Procedure:
1. Preheat oven: Set your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Prepare pans: Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.
3. Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Mix wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, vanilla extract, and sugar until well combined.
5. Combine wet and dry: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.
6. Add boiling water: Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin.
7. Bake: Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Cool: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
